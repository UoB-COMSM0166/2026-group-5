## Introduction
The game rules are as follows: the player enters from the entrance of the room, moves through doors connecting the rooms, avoids enemies, and finally finds the exit to escape. Once the game starts, the player only has a limited field of view while inside a room. The player must go through doors to reach other rooms and expand their visible area. During the game, enemies have a fixed field of view and patrol back and forth. The player needs to stay in the enemies’ blind spots to avoid being caught. If the player enters an enemy’s field of view, the enemy will immediately chase and capture them, resulting in a game over.
