# Final Idea

After thoughtful discussion and consideration, we decided to proceed with the **stealth game** concept. From an innovation perspective, the stealth game offers a more original direction, as similar projects have been less commonly developed in previous years. We also believe that this concept provides richer gameplay possibilities, allowing for more depth in mechanics such as movement, enemy behavior, and player decision-making. 

Although the stealth game presents a higher level of technical and design complexity compared to the Bomberman-based idea, we see this as a positive challenge rather than a limitation. The increased difficulty pushes us to learn more, experiment with advanced mechanics, and apply our skills in a more meaningful way. 

To sum up, we consider that the stealth game idea is more innovative, more engaging from a gameplay standpoint, and better aligned with our motivation to create a distinctive and well-crafted project.
